HealthHalo Threat Model & Privacy Notes

1. Data Privacy
- Sessions are ephemeral by default.
- Audio and video data are streamed directly to the Gemini Live API and are NOT stored on the server.
- Explicit user consent is required before accessing the microphone or camera.
- Consent status is logged to a database (simulating Firestore).
- Users can request to delete their session data instantly via an API endpoint.

2. Security
- The application runs on Google Cloud Run with HTTPS.
- The Gemini API key is stored securely in Secret Manager (or environment variables) and is never exposed to the client in a production environment (though in this prototype, it's injected via Vite for the frontend SDK to use).
- The Express server validates API requests.

3. Safety
- The system prompt strictly enforces that the agent is NOT a doctor and cannot diagnose.
- The agent is instructed to escalate to emergency services for life-threatening situations.
- The agent provides transparent explanations of uncertainty.
